# AutoCompleteTextBoxMe
Auto complete TextBox library that built in .Net for WPF Applications and Xamarin Apps

>This project is modified from orignal work [WPF AutoComplete TextBox](https://github.com/quicoli/WPF-AutoComplete-TextBox)

This libraries changed to meet AwthanSoft's requirements:
* The library has been restructured into multi libraries (Controller - ViewCtrl) to avoid repetition of codes.
* The controller library is built on (.Net Standard 2) to perform back-end functions
  and that allowing it to be called on several platforms and applications as WPF Applications and Xamarin Apps.
